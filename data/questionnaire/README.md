# README

This is questionnaire data from NESPOMILA and the two other data collection periods -- pre-NESPOMILA pilot study in Kashubia (2019) and the *New Speakers of Wymysorys* project (2017--2019)

## What's here?

### `CSB-pilot_questionnaire.osexp`

Questionnaire administered during the pilot study in Kashubia. Questionnaire is in `.osexp` format (OpenSesame stimulus display software).


### `CSB-pilot_questionnaire-data_anon.csv`

Anonymized questionnaire data from the pre-NESPOMILA pilot in Kashubia.


### `kashubian-speaker-mapping.csv`

Some individual participants contributed data to these projects at different times and received (automatically) subject-IDs or user IDs by stimulus display software -- this file maps these identifiers to each other so that the re-user of thse data can understand which individuals contributed which data.


### `NESPOMILA_questionnaire_models.py` & `NESPOMILA_questionnaire_forms.py`

These are the relevant fragments of code to allow one to reconstruct link the questionnaire questions to the answers in the `NESPOMILA_questionnaire-data.csv` file. Please don't recycle this garbage code; rather use the MOREDAT questionnaire app -- [here](https://github.com/bobborges/moredat) -- instead.



### `NESPOMILA_questionnaire-data.csv`

Answers to NESPOMILA questionnaire. Due to the fact that the `questionnaire` database model was not linked to the `user` model in the online data-collection software, there was no need to perform any manual anonymization.
